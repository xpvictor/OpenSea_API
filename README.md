<h2>Project objective</h2>
<p>
The project was developed with an educational focus, using Python 
to integrate via API with OpenSea and extract data available on the 
platform. The main goal is to practice acquired knowledge by 
generating structured files for analysis. Although it includes a Power BI 
dashboard, the core purpose lies in the Python files that enable data 
manipulation and visualization.
